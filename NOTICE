Esrille logo marks, including the es shield logo, are special trademarks
to identify the products being developed and distributed by Esrille Inc.

Esrille logo marks can be used by anyone if that use of the logo marks

companies) to use the trademark of another if:

     the trademark;
  2. The user only uses as much of the mark as is necessary to identify
     the product or service; and,
  3. The user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the
     trademark holder.
