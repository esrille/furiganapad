# FuriganaPad

FuriganaPad allows you to easily write Japanese text with Ruby annotations. With [Hiragana IME for IBus](https://github.com/esrille/ibus-hiragana), FuriganaPad automatically adds Ruby characters above Kanji as you type.

## About Ruby annotations

Kanji can be particularly challenging to read, especially for children in Japan. In Japan, children learn over a thousand Kanji characters during their six years of elementary school. Japanese books for children often include Ruby annotations in _Hiragana_, known as _Furigana_, on all Kanji characters. This method of adding _Furigana_ is known as '_Sô Furigana_' or 'Total Ruby.'

Recently, there has been an increase in opportunities to see and write sentences in plain, easy Japanese, known as ‘_Yasashii Nihongo_.’ Easy Japanese is also typically written with Total Ruby. _Furigana_ is also helpful for people with dyslexia.

These days, web browsers are capable of displaying _Furigana_. However, we don't often see content in Total Ruby due to the difficulty in content creation. FuriganaPad is designed to help you easily create and change texts with Total Ruby.
